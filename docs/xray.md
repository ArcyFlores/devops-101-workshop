# Xray Module


This module will walk you through Xray. We will cover software vulnerabilities and license compliance, go through setup, manually trigger a scan, and learn to read the results. Later on when we talk about CI/CD, you will learn how to trigger scans automatically and take certain actions based on the scan results.


## Overview


Xray is a tool that protects you from security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues that may be hidden in your software. Letâ€™s take a look at the Security and Compliance tab to see how we can automatically trigger warnings, fail a build, or even block downloads based on a threshold you set. JFrog Xray functions on a system of Policies and Watches. Policies allow us to define security and license compliance behaviors specific to your organization. Once they are defined, they are enforced by applying them to Watches.
