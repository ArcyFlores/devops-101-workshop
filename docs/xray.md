# Xray Module


This module will walk you through Xray. 


## Overview


Xray is a tool that protects you from security vulnerabilities and license compliance issues that may be hidden in your software. Letâ€™s take a look at the Security and Compliance tab to see how we can automatically trigger warnings, fail a build, or even block downloads based on a threshold you set. JFrog Xray functions on a system of Policies and Watches. Policies allow us to define security and license compliance behaviors specific to your organization. Once they are defined, they are enforced by applying them to Watches.
